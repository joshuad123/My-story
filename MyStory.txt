Soon the royal party from the ship is cast ashore and separated into three groups. 
The king's son, Ferdinand, is brought to Prospero, where he sees Miranda, and the two fall instantly in love. 
Meanwhile, Alonso, the king of Naples, and the rest of his party have come ashore on another part of the island. 
Alonso fears that Ferdinand is dead and grieves for the loss of his son. 
Antonio, Prospero's younger brother, has also been washed ashore with the king's younger brother, Sebastian. 
Antonio easily convinces Sebastian that Sebastian should murder his brother and seize the throne for himself.
This plot to murder Alonso is similar to Antonio's plot against his own brother, Prospero, 12 years earlier.
